# Tax Calculator Read Me


### General

Thanks for taking a look at my Read Me file!

This project was quite fun for me. I wanted to test myself and see if I could find a problem I run into on a regular basis and code a solution. Since I do our own budget for my family, I am often projecting our taxes that will be coming out of our paychecks, so I wanted to know more specifically.

The info I used to calculate the tax info came from taxfoundation.org.

### Languages

I am proud to say that I used the following languages/frameworks for this project:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
